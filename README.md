### About [Code-Aseter](http://www.code-aster.org)

Code_Aster is an open-source software for the analysis of finite
elements and numerical simulation in structural mechanics and
multiphysics. According to the typical classification of programs of
this type, Code_Aster is the solver or processing engine, not
including pre- or post-processing (object meshing and solution
presentation). Code_Aster was developed mainly by the French
company Électricité de France (EDF). The core of the system is
coded in Fortran, and many add-ons are made in Python.

Its application covers multiple disciplines: mechanical and thermal
three-dimensional analysis mainly, hydrodynamics, metallurgy,
hydration, drying, etc., whether they are stationary or transient
conditions, and both linear and non-linear processes. It also has
specific tools for fatigue, deformation, fracture, contact,
geotechnics, porous materials, etc. In addition, the combination of
these characteristics with the various pre- and postprocessing
programs allow it to cover areas such as acoustics, seismic, atomic
energy and others.
